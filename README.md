# AutomatingNumericalMathFunctions

This is my very first uploaded repository on GitHub. And at that, my first real implementation of automating using Python. I am putting this up to kick start my resume and start something ive been putting off for a while...

It begins with a very crude numerical derivative function that approximates and plots the derivative of a single variable input function. 
I am attempting to avoid the use of symbolic libraries in this repository for no other reason than a challenge that is of very modest difficulties to sharpen my algorithm formulation and coding skills. ALL help and advice is requested, no matter how cinical or critical.
Dont even hold back, try hurt my feelings. I want to improve as a coder by any means, so please do attach insights along with the cyber bullying.

I also want ideas for new updates and additions to this repository, any challenge. I have a feeling this will be fulled up mainly with mathematical related fucntions as there is many literature on the internet and in my *MECHANICAL ENGINEERING* textbooks.
Yeah, Im a Mechanical Engineer.
